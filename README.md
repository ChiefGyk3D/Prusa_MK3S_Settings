Prusa MK3S Settings

This is my personal repository of settings and tools for my Prusa 3D printer. It includes INI files, calibration tools, and STL files for printer tests. Most of the files are sourced from the community and have been modified as needed. Hot end temperatures may need to be adjusted for your setup, as I typically increase temperatures by 5-15C from stock to compensate for my setup. However, all other settings should work well with a completely stock system. Adjust Life Z has two versions for PETG, the ChiefGyk3D version merely runs hotter to accommodate my setup. 

Any files I have personally created are released under the GPL v3 license.

Modified profiles are based on my current hotend setup which includes:

    3D Passion Titanium Heat Break
    E3D Nickel Plated Copper Heat Block
    Midwest Tungsten Service v6 Nozzle
    E3D High Precision 40 Watt Heater
    Boron Nitride Thermal Paste
    Sunon Extruder Cooling fan
    Moons Stepper motor for extruder
    Nyloc Leveling Mod

I do not plan on doing mods that stray too far from the stock setup.

The firmware updates the stock branch firmware to include the G81 Firmware tweaks for the Nyloc mod. It's not necessary, but it can improve printing. Follow the guide here: https://github.com/PrusaOwners/prusaowners/wiki/Bed_Leveling_without_Wave_Springs
